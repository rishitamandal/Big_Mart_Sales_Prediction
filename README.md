# Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction #
## This is a prediction model using machine learning. ##

--> PROBLEM STATEMENT : The "Big Mart Sale Prediction" project involves creating a predictive model that can accurately forecast the sales of products in a Big Mart store. This involves analyzing historical sales data, as 
    well as various attributes such as product characteristics, store location, and more, to develop a model that can predict future sales. The goal is to help the store optimize inventory management and marketing 
    strategies based on these predictions.

--> ALGORITHM USED : 
   1. XGBoost for Regression -a Forecast for Big Mart Sales Based on Random Forests and Multiple Linear Regression used Random Forest and Linear Regression for prediction analysis which gives less accuracy. To overcome 
      this, we can use XGboost. Algorithm which will give more accuracy and will be more efficient.
   
   2. R-Squared (RÂ² or the coefficient of determination) is a statistical measure in a regression model that determines the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent 
      variable. In 
      other words, r-squared shows how well the data fit the regression model (the goodness of fit). A R-squared between 0.50 to 0.99 is acceptable in social science research especially when most of the explanatory 
      variables are statistically significant.

--> Importing The Dependencies : 
     1. Numpy : NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
     2. Pandas : Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
     3. Mathplotlib : Matplotlib is a python library used to create 2D graphs and plots by using python scripts. It has a module named pyplot which makes things easy for plotting by providing feature to control line 
        styles, font properties, formatting axes etc.
     4. Seaborn : Python Seaborn library is a widely popular data visualization library that is commonly used for data science and machine learning tasks.
